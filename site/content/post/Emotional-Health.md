## Create Joy and Satisfaction
Living with mental health conditions can be extremely stressful and taxing. Thus, it is important to find activities to alleviate your good feelings.

* Set daily goals for yourself and fulfil them.
* Get out and about â€“try to break away from your daily schedules.
* Live healthily through deting, sleeping and exercising on a regular basis.

## Connect with Yourself
It is important to evaluate and reflect on your journey thus far to figure out what is working and what is not working for your recovery.

* Keeping a journal is an effective way to detail your experiences and emotions to discover yourself in a safe and honest manner.
* Advocating and sharing your story serves as a powerful form of therapy â€“ as you feel empowered by reading the thoughts of others, you can empower others by doing the same!

## Working with the Community

Though spending time alone is beneficial, it is essential to mantain your social connections.

* You can expand your network by participating in local community groups that may share the same interest as you.
* You can also seek out local support groups to discuss and share ideas on key issues.
* Consider volunteering for community services.

## Take your time

There are loads of advice and tips out there, including this post, to guide you on how to spend your time and be productive. Such guides are helpful during turbulent and uncertain times; it is important not to pressure yourself but do things at your own pace!

## Reminder:
{{<callout>}}You do not have to constantly seek happiness and it is completely okay to be alone and feel your feelings. Some days, you may not feel like getting out of bed, but that's ok. Progress is not linear, and you do not always have to seek joy and satisfaction. {{</callout>}}
