  According to DSM-5, Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD)  is when an individual fears
  acting in a way that might make them get JUDGED. It is always tricky to deal
  with. Psychotherapy, the act of helping someone to control their wellbeing, is
  often used to treat social anxiety in the professional world. 


  For a layman audience, here are some tips to support the people going through a hard time!

Rather than trying to help by “fixing” the individual, it’s much more beneficial to prepare them to face these problematic recurring social situations one step at a time. Once you deal with these returning issues, ideally, the roots of their initial issue should wither away. As always and with most aspects of life, help them by remedying their anxiety with positivity and optimism. 



Very frequently, the symptoms of anxiety involve changes in one’s physicality, which can root from panic attacks causing a rapid increase in dread and breathing. In cases like this, the key to relaxing oneself is to breathe calmly:



* *Sit down in a comfortable position with your back straight.*
* *Relax your shoulders.*
* *Put one hand on your belly and the other on your chest.*
* *Breathe in slowly through your nose for 4 seconds. The hand that’s on your belly will rise and the one on your chest shouldn’t move much.*
* *Hold your breath in for 2 seconds and then slowly let it out through your mouth for 6 seconds.*
* *Repeat this several times until you feel relaxed.* 



In tense situations, a body workout where you tighten and relax different muscles will also resonate with your feelings, giving you a sense of tranquillity. 



Instinctively, it is also common for people to back out from the anxiety-inducing situation entirely. No one knows you better than yourself, so it can be helpful to plan ahead for these scenarios, giving yourself a sense of preparedness, control and confidence in case a sudden panic attack occurs. 



Since the fear of being judged by others is the core reason behind many SAD cases, by focusing on the environment and those around you and the conversations happening, it is easier to not consciously worry about presenting yourself to a standard you hold high and criticizing yourself. 



To truly understand the reasons as to why SAD is bothering you, it's important to clarify what one’s problems really are.  The only way to do so would be to be direct with yourself. To embellish negative thoughts with positive ones, you would first have to harness the disturbing thoughts you would have during anxiety by writing them down. A daily journal or a place to write your thoughts down can be extremely helpful as the problems can be on the paper in front of you, allowing you to directly decorate them with pragmatic and cheerful messages, turning the embers of your negativity into a bonfire of positivity. 



*At the end of the day, your biggest enemy can sometimes be yourself...but you are also your greatest friend.*
