# Living with Depression
> As a teenager, school and studies seem like the most stressful thing in the world. We feel the immense pressure to succeed by standards that have been put upon us. Living with depression can feel like being sucked into a hole, as though we are consumed by what is expected of us and the pressures there are to live up to those expectations. Not only that, but it becomes difficult to cope with it. In my personal experience, I've found it hard to even think about my feelings because all that matters was the fact that I feel unbelievably down and being stuck in the low place I was at. But I surrounded myself with people that truly care for me and love me for the person I am. Today I am able to love myself and define my own self-worth and happiness. â€“ Anonymous
