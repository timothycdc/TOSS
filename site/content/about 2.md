Hi, Tim here!
I've written this guide here so you can help contribute to Toss.

## 1. Blast Off!
Visit the [admin page](toss-my.netlify.app/admin/) and sign in. Click "login with Netlify Identity". For safety reasons the login details aren't on this page (obviously). Go and ask the right people for it ;)

This is what your homepage looks like! It shows a list of all the posts on the website, which are all editable. Now click 'New Post'.

Fill in the initial details – I've included ample instructions on how not to go wrong.
Don't forget to upload a cover image! See the [image]({{< relref "#images" >}}) section of this post for more details.

Scroll down to the **Body** Section. You will find that the switch is flipped to 'Rich Text' mode (toggle it otherwise). This mode helps get pretty much everything done without getting too fussy into the technical details and code. Click around on the buttons and mess around! It should help you get accustomed to the features.





What's Included:
- Bold and Italic styling
- Hyperlinks
- Set text size (Heading sizes included)
- Enable blockquotes (Quite similar to what you'd get in Notion)
- Bullet Lists and Number Lists

## 2. Postmaking – Things to note:
### Images
Try to use images close to Full-HD resolution (1920 x 1080), and the file size should be around 500kB. This size strikes a good balance between quality and website loading times.

You can find royalty-free illustration images on [Unsplash](unsplash.com). Don't forget to write an alternative text description for accessibility. More on accessibility [here.]({{< relref "#accessibility">}})



## 3. Advanced Markdown Features

## 4. Sustainability and keeping our costs free
