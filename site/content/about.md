Greetings from TOSS! Join us as we embark on a journey to build inclusivity and diminish social stigma on mental health by bringing more and more awareness to it. As teenagers, we find it especially important to bring light to these issues. We hope you can join us on our journey to destigmatise mental health and bring more and more awareness ðŸ’›

# 1. Who are we?
TOSS (The Other Side of the Story) is a safe platform for those dealing and those that have dealt with mental health issues. We support and connect victims, survivors, and professionals in order to improve society's understanding of mental health and the overall well-being of students.

# 2. Our Mission and Vision
To move towards an inclusive and non-judgemental society alongside a reformed support system that recognises the importance of mental health, encouraging the improvement of youths' well-being.

# 3. Our Logo
{{<rawhtml>}}
<div class="logo-circle-secondary"  style = 'margin-left: 5px;'>
                <div class="logo-txt-secondary">;</div>
            </div>
            <br>
{{</rawhtml>}}

The logo is a semicolon which is a symbol that stands in affirmation and solidarity with victims and survivors of mental health issues. Likewise, it represents continuation, where authors of stories would include semicolons when they choose not to end a sentence. The colour yellow conveys optimism, hope, and happiness.

Here're some keyboard shortcuts!

Go Home: `Alt` + `H`

Go to Search: `Alt` + `/`

Change Theme: `Alt` + `T`

Toggle Table of Contents: `Alt` + `C`

If you're on Mac, substitute the `Alt` keys with both the `Control^` and `Option` keys ^_^
